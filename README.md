## The OKX Token (OKB): What You Need to Know

Every major exchange has its own token, and OKX is no exception. The **OKX Token (OKB)** is the platform's native cryptocurrency, officially launched on March 23, 2018, by the OK Blockchain Foundation.

Originally built on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard, OKB has evolved and now runs on its own blockchainâ€”OKChain (OKC). That's right, they graduated from using someone else's blockchain to having their own. Growth, baby.

**Key Details About OKB:**
- **Ticker:** OKB
- **OKChain Contract:** 0xdf54b6c6195ea4d948d03bfd818d365cf175cfc2
- **Ethereum Contract:** 0x75231f58b43240c9718dd58b4967c5114342a86c
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Token Standard:** ERC-20
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum/OKChain
- **Token Type:** Exchange token
- **Market Cap:** Over $2.585 billion USD
- **Total Supply:** 300,000,000 OKB
- **Circulating Supply:** 60,000,000 OKB

The math here is interestingâ€”only 20% of the total supply is currently circulating. That's strategic scarcity working in favor of long-term holders.

## Is OKX Actually Trustworthy?

Look, in crypto, this is THE question everyone should be asking. Let's talk about OKX's credibility without the marketing fluff.

**Corporate Backing and Partnerships**
OKX is a subsidiary of OKcoin Group, a major player in the cryptocurrency world with a solid reputation. But they're not just riding on their parent company's coattails:

- They're the international partner of Manchester City Football Club. Yes, *that* Manchester City.
- They're the main sponsor of McLaren Racing, one of the world's premier racing teams.

These aren't small endorsements. Major global brands don't partner with sketchy exchanges.

**Regulatory Compliance**
Here's the big one: OKX secured a virtual asset license from Dubai's Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA). Getting regulatory approval isn't easyâ€”it means they passed serious scrutiny about their operations, security measures, and business practices.

**Asset Security Measures**
The platform operates a comprehensive asset protection system using both hot and cold wallets:

- **95% of customer cryptocurrency** is stored in cold wallets, completely offline and protected from hacker attacks
- **5% remains in hot wallets** to facilitate smooth trading operations

This is actually the industry standard for top-tier exchanges, and it's good to see OKX following best practices.

**Market Position**
According to Coingecko, OKX ranks in the **top 4 cryptocurrency exchanges globally** by trading volume. You don't get there by accidentâ€”it's earned through high security standards and modern security technology.

The platform employs state-of-the-art security systems including multi-layer encryption, two-factor authentication, and constant monitoring for suspicious activity.
